Hey Everyone, this is simple a test blog post to show you
the functionality of nuxt markdown blog.

In this article, we will explore the different ways to declare a variable in JavaScript.

We will also see why var is so problematic and why it must be avoided.

### **var** in a nutshell (aka Var Wars, _the Hoisting Menace_)

Until ES5, this is the only way to declare a variable.

<info-box>
  <template #info-box>
    This is a vue component inside markdown using slots
  </template>
</info-box>

```javascript
// Declaring variable
var sith;
// Init
sith = 'Darth Vader';
```

or directly

```javascript
// Declaring variable & init
var sith = 'Darth Vader';
```
